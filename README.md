# resume-screener-frontend

This is the React frontend for the Resume Screener project.  
It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes, and you may see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.  
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**  
This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies into your project for full control.
